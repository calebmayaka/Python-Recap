django is a python web framework that is used to develop scalable web applications
django uses the MVT model - it used models, view and templates 
in django you have to create a virtual environment using the command 

virtualenv new    - new is the name of the virtual environment

if virtualenv is not installed then yoy have to install it using the command - pip install virtualenv

then activating the virtual environment

new/scripts/activate

after activating the virtual environemnt we can then install django and all the other dependacies that are required by the project

pip install django

then creating a new project

django-admin startproject JobPortal

then creating an app in the project

python manage.py startapp loginandsignin

different modules of the system are designed in different apps which enhance modularity and can be reused

each app has urls, templates - the urls define where the user will be routed to when he/she goes to  spcific link.


urls map a user to a perticular view

templates can be passed over to urls to be diplayed

there are two types of urls, the one in the root directory of the project and the urls in the individual app projects

pathway

main project path urls  -  application urls   -  application views   -  applicatin templates

inheritance can be used in templated to reduce the redundancy of the code
